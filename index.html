<p>The Unity3D product is quite complex and sophisticated.  It is quick and easy to construct a simple project and be successful.  But fully harnessing the immense power and detailed capabilities requires a bit more effort.
Over a period of months, working in various stages of development with multiple projects, we have accumulated many tips and tricks.
  These, all, have come as a result of struggles and stumbles.  We hope YOU can benefit from the sweat and tears we have shed in YOUR work with the Unity3D platform.</p>
