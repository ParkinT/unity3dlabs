===========

The learning curve for Unity3D development can be very steep.  This site is intended to help reduce the friction in gaining mastery of this magnificent and versatile tool.

We have spent much time working with Unity3D.  It has been a process of discovery and learning.  It also has generated frustration.  We hope to help document and share the fruits of our experience with Unity3D and showcase some of the projects we have created.

This will serve the additional purpose of being a single repository of our collective knowledge; a reference guide and reminder of the details we have learned.
