  <p><span class="date indent">Sunday</span>The team been making <a href="index.html" target="_blank">good progress</a> incrementally.  This is <strong>CRUNCH DAY</strong>!  We will "Cross the Stream" and expect the Nexus of Creativity to fulfill our collective vision of a Virtual World for the player(s) to explore.  <a href="VRtifact.html">Here is what we created</a> together!</p>

  <p><span class="date indent">Saturday</span>As we hear teams around us discussing (arguing?) about code in Unity3D, we have nothing to show yet.  That <strong>is</strong> a bit frustrating.  We are making some good progress with the Occulus, Leap and Myo devices, however.  With 8 people working on Art, Models, Textures and Environment and now three coders (the team has grown since yesterday) I am confident we will have a high-quality product.  At least it had better look good! &lt;g&gt;</p>

  <p>We have established a set of "rules" for the User Interaction (gestures) and are making some important decisions about which of the VR technologies to devote our time implementing.</p>

    <p><span class="date indent">Friday</span>Beginning the evening of January 23, a group of twelve dedicated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_video_game_development" target="_blank">Indie Game Creators</a> (The Dirty Dozen) committed themselves to create an immersive Virtual Reality experience in a weekend.  The constraint of the Game Jam forced the team to focus and collaborate closely, in a very short time-frame in order to achieve a working product based on the theme assigned: <em>"What do we do now?"</em>
    <p><em>What do we do now?</em> quite aptly portrayed the common mood in the <a href="http://tic.ocls.info/audio/" target="_blank">Melrose Center</a> when this theme was revealed.  The agreed-upon game concept was dubbed <strong class="vrtifact">vR-tifact</strong> by combining the <strong>V</strong>irtual <strong>R</strong>eality with <em>Artifact</em>.
  <p><strong>Organiztion</strong> included the creation of a PMP (Chad), a Trello Board (Matt Parkin) and a git repository on GitHub (Thom Parkin).  With these organizational tools established we all retired Friday night (actually very early Saturday morning), committed to begin again early on Saturday.</p>
